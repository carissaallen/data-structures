# Data Structures

Here's a list of data structures and algorithms I intend to review:

* Data types
* Basic Bitwise Operations
* String Operations
* Arrays
* Linked Lists
	* Singly Linked
	* Doubly Linked
	* Circular Linked
* Queues
* Stacks
* Heaps
* Trees
	* Binary Trees
	* Binary Search Trees
	* Tries
	* Self Balancing Trees
* Traversing Trees
	* Breadth First Search - BFS
	* Depth First Search - DFS
	* Preorder, Inorder, Postorder
* Graphs
	* Dijkstra's Algorithm / A* Search
* Hash Maps
	* Handling Collisions
* Sorting algorithms
	* Insertion
	* Selection
	* Merge
	* Quick
* Time Complexities
